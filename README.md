# Chris Mecca

Systems engineer since 1997.  I design and debug production systems: performance
bottlenecks, distributed systems failures, migrations, observability, and infrastructure
that needs to run for years.

Currently at AWS Professional Services working on HPC, ML/AI infrastructure, distributed
systems, and architecture problems without obvious solutions.

## Current Work

- Building tools for performance analysis and distributed systems debugging
- Writing about engineering topics at [moonlab.org](https://moonlab.org)
