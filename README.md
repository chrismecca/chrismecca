 Systems engineer since 1997.  I design and debug production systems: performance
 bottlenecks, distributed systems failures, migrations, observability, and infrastructure
 that needs to run for years.

 Currently at AWS Professional Services working on HPC, ML/AI infrastructure, distributed
 systems, and architecture problems without obvious solutions.

 ## Current Work
 
 - Building tools for performance analysis and distributed systems debugging
 - Writing about engineering topics at [moonlab.org](https://moonlab.org)
